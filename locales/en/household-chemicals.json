Cleaning formulations should be highly effective without adverse effects on the surfaces to be cleaned. Cleaning and decontamination agents also vary in their degree of aggressiveness according to their intended purpose. They are usually complex preparations with ingredient compositions designed to deliver specific properties.

We offer raw materials for manufacturers of liquid, powder and tablet household chemicals, i.e. for manufacturers of dishwashing liquids and gels, dishwasher tablets and liquids, washing and cleaning liquids, powders, laundry gels and liquids, fabric softeners, toilet blocks and gels, air fresheners, and raw materials for industrial cleaning liquids (e.g. for production halls, utility halls, car washes).
